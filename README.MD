## Compling

**Unix systems only**

Before doing anything, make sure to install these dependencies:
* MSFL
* Makefile
* GCC
* MinGW

After all of these are installed, we use the Makefile to compile it:
```
make compile
```
And then use this command to run it:
```
make run
```

If you want to compile an executable file for Windows systems use this:
```
make compilewin
```
But unless you are in a Windows system you can't run it. If you are just open app.exe
